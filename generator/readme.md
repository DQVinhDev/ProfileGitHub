# @leonsilicon's README Generator

This folder contains the code that's used to generate my profile README. The image used is located at [`./data/image.png`](./data/image.png), which is a Figma design exported as a PNG image. The configuration used to specify which parts of the image are linkable can be found at [`./data/image-config.json`](./data/image-config.json). The TypeScript code used to generate the README is contained in [`./scripts/generate-readme.ts`](./scripts/generate-readme.ts).
